# The WiFi sharing app you hope to have

WiFi problems, we've all had them, and sometimes they come at the worst time like when you're looking for a coffee shop to finish up that essay or send that urgent email. With Sygnal, users can be connected to internet practically anywhere for a small price. Moreover, users can also sell their unused data on their internet plan to other Sygnal users.
